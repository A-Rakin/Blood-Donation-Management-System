# Blood-Donation-Management-System

This is a beginner Friendly Project named Blood Donation Management System. The language used here is HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript and MySql. I did that project in my university Database Management System Course. In this system, there is a segment where any donor can give their info and it will store their information. If anyone needs blood, they can search the blood in the blood group section and can contact with the donor. This is how it works.
